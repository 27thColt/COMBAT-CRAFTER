/*  4/26/2020 1:43am - Player Entity 
 *  Oh my god I can already tell this will be good for me
 * 
 *  Okay, this manages all player related stats-- as time goes on I will have to delegate any
 *  abstract stat based stuff to another script and animations to this one
 * 
 *  The term 'object' is used to refers to a physical gameobject that can be seen in the scene rather than the data type (at least the way I use it)
 
    8/2/2020 3:32pm - Okay so what I predicted has come to pass,,

    This script is almost useless now

    The Reason why this script doesnt exist anymore?
    All the data and stat related information has been moved to PlayerData.cs
    And all the rest,, which means animation related stuff,, has been merged ith PlayerEntityAniamtor.cs

public class PlayerEntity : MonoBehaviour {
    //private EntityAnimator.IEntityAnimator _entityAnimator = null;
